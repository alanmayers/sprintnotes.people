# Sprint 52

Hello, this is Alan, a content designer working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). At the end of each sprint I will provide an update of the work the members team have done and what we have learned in the process.

##### The team’s current focus:
> Make written questions and answers easy to find, easy to comprehend and a trusted source for re-use.

##### What we’ve done
We welcomed new arrivals to the members team:

* Dia moved from the utilities team to become our product manager, following Colin’s recent departure.
* A new Victor joined the team as delivery manager.
* Ed – our portal into the inner-workings of Parliament – has spent more time with us.
* We’ve now settled in to our area in Richmond House.

Change is the only constant.

Then we set to work:

* We added to the written questions and answers on our development platform.

* [Bryony](https://twitter.com/bryonywatson1?lang=en) worked through the data relating to the different states the questions and answers exist in (from question posed to answer given – and everything in-between).

* Withdrawn questions are being investigated.

* Naz returned from holiday and began working on potential measures for written questions and answers.

* [Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang?lang=en) designed a journey to allow users to find written questions by the departments and bodies providing the answers.

* This led to an interesting conversation about government departments and parliamentary bodies that helped us create our final list of answering bodies.

* Joshua built a prototype for testing the journey.

* [Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak?lang=en) ran remote user testing and the team watched the recordings: always a fascinating and educating experience.

* Following testing the team participated in a collaborative analysis session.

* The team agreed it would be wise to run lab research, so we can further assess what we have made so far.

* We have a list of labs to consider for testing as ours are currently unavailable due to office refurbishments.

* Bryony did even more data investigation. She’s the team’s data detective and we all appreciate the discoveries she makes.

* We listed questions we have for Parliament’s Table Office ahead of some of the team meeting with them next sprint.

* Marttiina continued to share her research expertise with the team by holding research review sessions. This sprint we learned more about observation strategies.

##### Other things members of the team did

* Began reworking the beta homepage so it meets our needs

* Reviewed our contact journey documents and asked, ‘what do we actually know?’

* Lunched with [Caroline](https://twitter.com/carolinekippler), our previous delivery manager

* Helped out at Hansard

#### Random things we’ve learned or have been reading:

* The team have joked about adding a tarot element to retros… but now we have [The Tarot Cards of Tech](https://www.artefactgroup.com/the-tarot-cards-of-tech/) we may have a new element to our future retros

* [GDPR scrambling has spawned a swell of data protection ‘charlatans’](https://digiday.com/media/gdpr-scrambling-spawned-swell-data-protection-charlatans/)

* [Unreasonably aspirational: leadership in a digital age](https://medium.com/ontariodigital/unreasonably-aspirational-leadership-in-a-digital-age-8dda4d07e0)

* [Grammar consternation and the US constitution](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/21-divide-and-conquer) and the return of Revisionist History

* [Caliphate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html), Rukmini Callimachi's new podcast series, is as great as her other journalism

* [What the font](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) – for when you absolutely need to know the name of a font spotted in the wild

#### More Sprintnotes
Fred continues his strong start to 'sprintnotes' with more [updates](https://ukparliament.github.io/sprintnotes.outputs/) from the outputs team. 

#### Huge thank you
I need to close my first edition of Sprintnotes with a thank you to [Jake](https://twitter.com/carboia) for his fast and thorough assistance with the technical aspects of this edition. Without his help it wouldn't have happened - so thank you, Jake!
