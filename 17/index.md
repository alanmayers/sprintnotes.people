# Sprint 53

Hello, this is [Alan](https://twitter.com/alanmayers), a content designer working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). At the end of each sprint I will provide an update of the work the members team have done and what we have learned in the process.

##### The team’s current focus:
> Make written questions and answers easy to find, easy to comprehend and a trusted source for re-use.

##### What we’ve done

Visited Parliament's Table Office

[Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak?lang=en) and [Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang?lang=en) ventured over to the Table Office to learn more about the behind-the-scenes process for written questions and answers. During the visit they learned about:

* staffing at the Table Office
* their day-to-day procedures
* how questions are checked for appropriateness and accuracy
* the relationship between oral and written questions

Examined the data

Naz presented us with analytics around the performance of our beta pages. The key points were:

* clicks on the banner from the current site to the beta site has decreased by 15%
* there has been a 64% increase in feedback clicks
* this meets our goal for the banner, which is to increase feedback
* the number of email and telephone clicks on members’ pages have decreased
* the most popular MP remains Diane Abbott, followed by Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn
* our most common user profile is male, aged 25-34 who has come direct to the site

Learned from the Lords' portraits project

Following the successful launch of the Lords' portraits we had a retrospective. There were lots of positives and room for some improvement:

* the process has improved since the MP's portraits
* the quality is consistent with the high levels set by the original portraits project
* improvements could be made in delegating administrative tasks to other teams
* opportunities should be taken to thank colleagues for significant contributions

Progressed with written questions and answers

Bryony worked on getting questions/id pages on devci. We now have pages for:

* questions that have been answered
* currently unanswered questions
* pages for questions asked by Lords (as well as MPs)

[Joshua](https://twitter.com/joshuawaheed) has been busy this sprint implementing a global non-opinionated toggle-function with JavaScript. At the moment we have a toggle specifically for dropdowns, which is limiting for what we hope to do with department filter-menus.

Joshua also implemented the answer page list component into Pugin, which we've categorised as an 'events list'. You can view the component in our main Pugin app [here](http://parliament-uk-pugin.herokuapp.com/templates/prototypes/_lists.html).

Participated in a design session

Victor held another fantastic design session for the team where we:

* set challenges based on the findings from our remote testing
* created designs for how we could meet the identified user needs

##### What we have planned

That is all for this edition of sprint notes. A lot of the team are on leave during the next sprint, but we are all excited by the round of lab testing Marttiina has arranged.

I promise to tell you all about it next time.
