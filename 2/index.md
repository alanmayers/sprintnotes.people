# Sprint 38
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus remains on helping users to:
* find a MP or Lord
* contact a MP or Lord
* understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens

##### What we’ve done
This was designated as a *Ghost Sprint* as lots of people from around PDS & within our team were using up their last remaining leave. What we achieved;

* added 'related links' on MP and Lord pages - specifically showing personal websites, Facebook links and Twitter links. (understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens + an alternative way to contact members)
* we wrote out a draft strategy for links and began to define what we show and where - this will evolve over time.
* finished off government roles (understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens)
* fixed a bug on our postcode constituency lookup. Previously [Find you MP](https://beta.parliament.uk/mps) would take you direct to an MP but the [Find your constituency](https://beta.parliament.uk/find-your-constituency) tool was also going direct to MP pages instead of the specific constituency. (find a MP or Lord)
* more work on cookie pages
* fixed content error on our 404 pages
* held a discovery session about speeches and oral contributions - this is prep work before our discovery phase into solving the need of 'How does my MP/Lord represent me'. (understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens)
* some peer analysis on how others (inc. other Parliaments) display members activity to their users. (understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens)
* fixed a bug about accidentally linking to beta instead of the current site in the footer of our site.
* more work on adding content to our pages 
* based on feedback from a usability session we also investigated if we could improve the [maps on our constituency pages](https://beta.parliament.uk/constituencies/Lyi1ncGp). We've picked out two immediate quick wins and will investigate about other longer term solutions next sprint.
* show and tell also occurred that went very well. The always engaging [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattrayner) shared updates & a great update from our ex-team member [Dana](https://twitter.com/dana_demin) about recent user research findings.

##### Random things I’ve learned
* really good to have another deep dive into other Parliament pages. Always interesting to see what others display and how it's designed.
* when auditing links of members I came across some very strange ones. Started writing a blogpost about it...
* understood some of the ramifications around what happens when an MP gets suspended (and the difference between suspended by a party and [by Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_from_the_UK_parliament)).
* reading about how [citizens can be trusted](https://aeon.co/essays/why-rule-by-the-people-is-better-than-rule-by-the-experts) with democratic responsibility
* alternative means of [showing off the characters](http://www.corelondon.tv/c/politics/meet-the-mps/) of the people of Parliament
* discovering ways MPs share [the contact they receive](http://chionwurahmp.com/2013/12/open-data-competition-winning-entry/) and [the activity they are up to](http://chionwurahmp.com/2017/10/dear-newcastle-14/)
