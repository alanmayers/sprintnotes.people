# Sprint 49

Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus:
> Make written questions and answers easy to find, easy to comprehend and a trusted source for re-use.

##### What we’ve done
Our firebreak between alpha and beta was wrapped up. Then we kicked off our first week of Written Questions and Answers Beta.

_Written Questions and Answers Beta began! Pic of the team in action - bit blurry soz._

What we have achieved:
* Some great work from Naz updating stakeholders if we are hitting our measures of success:
* [x] *Lords Members Portraits:* Overall, the release of the Lord’s images has had a really positive impact, with more people visiting the site consistently and users interacting with the different images available. Users are also contacting Lord’s more than they were before.
* [x] *Banner connecting the current site and beta:* There are significantly more users and pageviews for the beta page compared to the previous 30 days. We have had an increase of 3900% for people clicking to leave feedback. We have also noticed an upturn in the amount of feedback through other mediums to the people team (e.g. Webmaster)
* Naz continues to measure and has been working on getting the measures of success for Written Questions and Answers in a good place
* The team did an alpha retrospective with Victor (as a stand in for [Caroline](https://twitter.com/carolinekippler)) - new style. Constructive points emerged and have been put into action!
* We lost the fantastic [Jake](https://twitter.com/carboia?lang=en) to another team and gained the delightful [Joshua](https://twitter.com/joshuawaheed?lang=en). Welcome Joshua!!
* We have been writing a report to wrap up alpha.
* We did a beta kick off morning, which included clarifying our goals, jobs to be done to do, got a new mascot, identified target users, barriers and context we need to remember and a little team charter to live by
* [Bryony](https://twitter.com/bryonywatson1?lang=en) has been tackling SPARQL queries
* Sharing with colleagues what the priorities of our data requests
* [Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang?lang=en) & Bryony also had a great chat with colleagues about options on what we could deliver. Colleagues quite literally rubbed their belly in glee.
* [Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak?lang=en) did two great sessions on team questions for beta and beyond & our research plan for beta
* Discussions of headings/titles of written questions (this will be an upgrade of what we currently do but has its own challenges)
* Chats about other research from other teams or from before our team that is relevant to our current work
* [Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang?lang=en) considering where our first stab at the best home for answers would be
* [Alan](https://twitter.com/alanmayers) chatting about what content needs to be on the answers page
* We stuck up the designs on the wall and went through them
* Show and tell prep

Wider team work:
* I got feedback on my sprintnotes format. Feedback is good. Change is good.
* [Bryony](https://twitter.com/bryonywatson1?lang=en) was a good teacher to new back-end devs. They were loving her SPARQL tutorial. She is also in charge of the retro next week. She's been researching what would be a fun session to do.
* Chats with the team about what's going on with the roadmap meetings inside our own organisation
* [Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang?lang=en) cropping/adding more portraits.
