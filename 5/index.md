# Sprint 41
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus remains on helping users to:
* ~~find a MP or Lord~~
* ~~contact a MP or Lord~~
* understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens

##### What we’ve done
We are at the end-point of our 'Members Activity' discovery. It's been brilliant. There are so many opportunities that it's borderline overwhelming. I can't compliment the team enough - really nice atmosphere and great diligent work.

What we achieved in the discovery thus far;

* 1 full week of interviews with journalists, campaigners and public/voters - blogs will follow. [Marttiina](https://twitter.com/MarttiinaK) you ace'd it
* [multiple days](https://twitter.com/MarttiinaK/status/938081172571205633) of [analysis](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/938117016979943426) of our findings
* doing secondary research and sharing with the team
* discussion with 3 Lords about our work thus far. Really really really encouraging. Even got to have a quick chat with [Lord Kirkwood](https://www.libdems.org.uk/archy_kirkwood) about the beauty of Northumberland.
* more investigations into the data and systems that make up members activity
* investigations into the content around members activity
* thoughts on ethics and potential risks of the work
* more chats on business needs
* added to our list of activities and [Ben](https://twitter.com/benwoodhams) popped over to help us out with explaining what happens in the House of Lords. [Ed](https://twitter.com/ewhitur) also deserves credit for always being around with guidance
* heard updates from the team that created [the record for the Welsh assembly](http://record.assembly.wales/) - very useful
* great explanations about [questions and answers](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/question-and-answer/question-and-answer-ontology.html) and creating ontologies from [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) - thoroughly deserved ovation from audience
* writing up findings and prepping for finishing off our discovery. We are following [this practice to wrap-up our discovery phase](http://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/finishing-off-a-discovery) - days/rooms/agenda prepped.

Wider team work;
