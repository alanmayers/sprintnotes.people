# Sprint 47

Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus remains on helping users to:
* ~~find a MP or Lord~~
* ~~contact a MP or Lord~~
* understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens

##### What we’ve done
This was the sprint of Alan’s glorious birthday. Kinder treats were consumed. We also came to the end of members activity alpha and rushed to get Lords pages ready for release.

What we have achieved:
* Nas looked into [written q’s and a’s](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-questions-answers/) on the current site and delved into the usage of [‘Daily Reports’](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/daily-reports/). Great summary that spawned more questions!
* We had our [3rd round of research! Final of alpha](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/974598206104403968?s=19). Lots learned and explored over the 3 rounds.
* We [analysed the findings from the 3rd round of testing](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/971731261722189825?s=19) - insights discovered such as journalists place a high value on time stamped info since it aids them in finding the activity they are after so they can verify the info is accurate and reliable to report on
* We organised all of the alpha wrap up that starts in the next sprint (Colin went mad and booked rooms all around the estate - a tour of every building in Parliament about to commence)
* Write ups of findings and testing
* BA chats - Karol chatted to people in the business and a staff member for an MP came over for a chat > very interesting to hear how activity in Parliament is affected if the MP represents a place with devolved status (basically they won’t get involved with things around devolved powers, e.g. Health)
* Michael of [data weeknotes](https://ukparliament.github.io/weeknotes.data-search/) fame popped by to tell us about Oral Q & A things and set up time with Bryony to look into URLs.

Wider team work:
* Lords photos work consumed some of the team. Mainly chasing and fixing things. Credit to Bryony, Alan and Jake for helping to do the following: 
* Re-designing the Lords pages and adding media pages so users can download the new portraits
* Identifying and pushing for deceased, missing, ineligible & retired members of the House of Lords being accurate and up to date
* Fixing broken contact details on Lords pages
* Providing good service and making name changes that were requested by a Baroness before the photos go live
* Scrubbing up the content on the page to do with members of the HOL.
* Helping to make sure the count of members is correct
* Noticing, documenting and pushing for wonky crops and odd colour issues being amended.
* identifying measures of success before the release of the portraits.
* Colin went to show’n’tell with colleagues in the Lords Library
* Roadmap chats and team structure changes happened
* Changes to the roles pages is making progress
* Adding a banner to the old website + beta pages is done. Ready to pull the trigger post-Lord photo release - Naz also been thinking about maybe A/B testing where the banner is.
* Chats with [Laurence](https://twitter.com/laurencegrinyer?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) about democratic values
* Chats about the future of A/V in Parliament
* Really [engaging talk organised by ParliOUT](https://twitter.com/ParliOUT/status/974357233168502784)

#### Alan birthday special section
Alan’s quote for this sprint: 
> "The vague, living countryside, the moon, the remains of the day did their work in me; so did the gently downward road, which forestalled all possibility of weariness. The evening was near, yet infinite.” - Jorge Borges
