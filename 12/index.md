# Sprint 48

Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus remains on helping users to:
* ~~find a MP or Lord~~
* ~~contact a MP or Lord~~
* understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens

##### What we’ve done
Mostly big releases and wrapping up alpha.

What we have achieved:
* Work on [PeerPortraits](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/975779236089946112).
* PeerPortraits dropped! (some Bishops in the mix too). Lots of collaboration with other teams, photographers, peers + bishops, those in the House of Lords and data and search colleagues. [Our team did a whole bunch and I hope they get the credit they deserve](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/976146650459770880).
* [Watching](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/976105853295255552) people [share them](https://twitter.com/ParliDigital/status/976123642068291584) and [do cool things with them](https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/976424407043276802).
* Responding to requests from colleagues
* Lots of effort on [alpha wrap-up](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/976059155218825216)
* Including coming to [a shared understanding in the team](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/977180508575731713) about what we discovered
* [Passionate discussions](https://twitter.com/MarttiinaK/status/975788820208680960)
* Splitting down users from alpha. E.g. in discovery we started with intermediaries, we learned more and started to look into journalists and now we know even more about the different types of journalists that amplify members activity to a wider audience
* Bit of empathy mapping
* From findings we wrote [jobs to be done](https://jtbd.info/). Giving them a go for beta.
* They are in the backlog and prioritised by the team
* In reality we are constrained with what we can deliver right now, this means we can't pull from the top of the backlog, but we have a plan to how to get there. It'll take a few months, but we have a path forward agreed with colleagues. A blast of written questions will come first.
* We [unveiled a banner on the current website](https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/laura-pidcock/4665) to beta. Aim is to gather more user feedback on our pages.
* Extra business analysis with MP staff and others. Feedback is always good.

Wider team work:
* I spoke at [a show and tell](https://twitter.com/ParliDigital/status/976503236747284481)
* We spoke with two researchers from [TheyWorkForYou](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/). Great chat and very useful, hope more chats follow. Shout out to [Alan](https://twitter.com/alanmayers) for setting up and being a top host.
* Colleague [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife?lang=en) setup a great chat with [Tony Ageh](https://twitter.com/tonyageh?lang=en) who is the chief digital officer for New York Public libraries. Interesting comments about leadership and vision. Interesting insights into PeerPortraits also available on their [fantastic weeknotes](https://ukparliament.github.io/weeknotes.data-search/2018/12/).
* [new identity in the spotlight](https://twitter.com/clementgraphics/status/977247404524228612)
* My excellent colleague [Fred](https://twitter.com/gwizxrd) is also getting on the [sprint notes train](https://ukparliament.github.io/sprintnotes.outputs/)!
