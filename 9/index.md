# Sprint 45

Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus remains on helping users to:
* ~~find a MP or Lord~~
* ~~contact a MP or Lord~~
* understand how a MP or Lord represent citizens

##### What we’ve done
We are powering through our alpha phase. Team [working amazingly together](https://twitter.com/laurencegrinyer/status/961643841936904192).

What we have achieved:
* Prototyping, learning and putting things in front of users (inc asking about how users use the current site, reactions to our prototypes and letting them assess the laguage and content within the prototype)
* Insight 1 from first round of testing - People want to know what is important to an MP in terms of interests and issues, because it helps them to understand the MP as a person and check whether what they say they care about matches what they do. Challenge for team - How might we show the relationship between what MPs say they do and what they actually do in Parliament
* Insight 2 - Journalists reporting on Parliamentary activity and politics look for facts about what is going on in Parliament recently, because they need to make sure they cover all relevant aspects of it for their readers. Challenge for the team - How might we relate what an MP is doing to what is happening in Parliament as a whole
* Lots of [analysis, feedback](https://twitter.com/MarttiinaK/status/958446489495273473)
* [Design days with the team](https://twitter.com/ParliDigital/status/964166494362927111)
* An insight from the second round of testing - Journalists find the dialogue between MPs and the government an interesting source for writing stories. Challenge for team - How might we help journalists identify what is interesting in written questions and answers
* Insight 2 - Reporting journalists need to be reactive and look for activities based on when they have happened in Parliament, because they approach covering Parliamentary activity from a broad perspective in the first instance, rather than what an individual MP has done. Challenge for team - How might we present a broad picture of parliamentary activity without overwhelming the user
* Written Q's and A's likely to be first activity ready to deliver so extra work around them, including potential measures of success
* BA catch-ups
* Roadmapping work

Wider team work:
* We have a milestone to add a banner promoting the new beta pages in March so more work towards achieving that
* The early steps towards Lords photos have begun
* More work on [groups and answering bodies](https://github.com/ukparliament/ontologies/blob/master/urls.csv)
* Trying to promote the creation of a cross-legislature community
* More topics/concepts chat - important for activity
* Helping out plans to [make PDS more engaging on social media](https://twitter.com/ParliDigital)
* [Bryony](https://twitter.com/bryonywatson1) [helped to put on codebar](https://twitter.com/bryonywatson1/status/959013752057356288) which is very cool and should be applauded!
