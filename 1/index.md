# Sprint 37
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

##### The team’s current focus remains on helping users to:
* find a MP or Lord
* contact a MP or Lord
* understand how a MP or Lord represents them.

##### What we’ve done
* Added a members position in a Government department. (understand how a MP or Lord represents them)
* Finished off work on members membership to a committee (understand how a MP or Lord represents them)
* Finished off work on writing up the findings from a recent usability session (related to find a MP or Lord)
* Had a brilliant session ran by our designer [Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang) about how to tackle the usability issues we discovered
* Had a great session discussing future work and possibilities in regards to written questions (understand how a MP or Lord represents them)
* Fixed a number of bugs - lots to do with our ‘all’ button on our list pages, one that amended our content on “immigation” and “bullet visas”.
* Worked on a more prominent status banner (with a neat little icon)
* Worked on our cookie pages
* More discussions around best ways to add content to our pages
* Discussions and background work to help add social media links and links to a members personal website on our beta pages (contact work)
* More research on bettering our contact journey (contact work)
* More research on what users need from voting records type info (understand how a MP or Lord represents them)

##### Random things I’ve learned
* Surgeries are a relatively recent occurrence. I had romantic views that MPs had been regularly going back to their constituencies for hundreds of years. In fact I was told surgeries are quite recent phenomena, only really got going from the 60’s onwards.
* Stuff on Written Questions that constrains what we might deliver in the first iteration.
* Information about Financial Interests systems and reporting.
* Also been thinking on the need for cross-Parliamentary network. Even started a blog post.
* [Nice chat in the Lords about AI](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/ai-committee/news-parliament-2017/first-evidence-session/)
* Good chats about democracy in the digital age with colleagues
* Bits and bobs in [colleagues weeknotes](https://ukparliament.github.io/weeknotes.data-search/).
