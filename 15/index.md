# Sprint 51

Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). Each sprint I’m going to keep a running update of the work we’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

#### Random things we’ve learned or have been reading:
BUMPER EDITION
* “One of the first things Liam Fox ever said to me, back when he was Chairman of the Party years ago, was: “You have to be absolutely clear about what your loyalty is. Your loyalty first and foremost, before anything else at all, is to your constituents. They’re the ones who employ you, they’re the ones who voted for you, and they’re the ones that you must look after. Number two is your loyalty to your country and you’ve got to think about the national picture. Only when you’ve satisfied those two things can you then be loyal to your party.” It was an interesting bit of advice which I’ve never forgotten.” - [Mark Garnier interview](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-reflect/person/mark-garnier/)
